I am plan to use machine learning part of Python and Tableau/Power BI dashboards.

Insigts:

1. The majority of arrests are not successfull( only 12% success)
2. The majority of arrests are not domestic( only 21% are domestic)
3. The most dangerous district: 6,8,4,12,25
4. In the district number 4 police have the more successful arrest rather in others
5. 1834 police of beat have a lot of crimes, 2650,2340 and 2044 also
6. The most popular location of crime are street,apartment,residense,sidewalk,park location: police need to be more concentrated hear
